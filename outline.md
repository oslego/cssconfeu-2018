# DevTools for Designers

- Length: 30min
- Goal: showcase existing DevTools features & start conversation about developing new tools as extensions.

## Parts

0. Preamble
  - Golden Age for web platform:
    - most capable than ever;
    - most uniformly distributed features than ever;
  - web standards, libraries, frameworks. there is choice!
  - the web is not dying; it's thriving.
  - concede that there is reason to feel overwhelmed by choice
  - capable DevTools in all browsers => building for the web is more productive than ever.
  - great for web developers; what about web designers?
  - intro & agenda

1. Acknowledgement of DevTools & its history
  - Firebug origins
  - Extensibility + community of enthusiasts
  - Dabblet by Lea Verou (online CSS editor with specialized property previews)

2. What web designers need so they can design in the browser?
    - not about designers learning how to code
    - expectations of their tools in order to become productive:
      - freedom: canvas which encourages free-from exploration; DIRECT MANIPULATION
      - confidence: undo/redo, save changes, versioning
      - specialized tools: code is an abstraction; slow to get from idea to visual means less experimentation
      - ergonomics: ability to customize, personalize, save and share pattern libraries

3. Freedom
  - no DevTools implements a free-form canvas yet
    - everything interacts in CSS/HTML (good, because you want to see real end results)
    - difficult to fit into the underlying structure of foreign codebases
    - not everything will be new development.
  - Webflow (video)
  - Chris Heilmann's "Sacrificing the Golden Calf of Coding"

4. Confidence (3min)
  - Problem: changes in DevTools are lost on refresh; ephemeral (can't share with others)
  - Chrome Local Overrides (video)

5. Specialized Tools
  - CSS Grid Inspector (video)
  - CSS Filter Editor (video)
  - Variable Fonts Editor (demo)
  - Shape Path Editor (demo)
  - (TBD) CSS Animation Inspector (video?)
  - (TBD) CSS Transform Previews (video?)
  - Gradient Editor in Safari + cssgradient.io (demo)
  - Examples of tools as micro-websites / prototypes.
    - time preview in Dabblet (Lea Verou)
    - angle editor (Nicolas Chevobbe)
    - gradient inspector (Rafael Caricio)
    - transforms editor (Gilmore Davidson)
    ...

6. Ergonomics & Future
  - AJ Kandy: "A DevTools for Designers"
  - Jen Simmons: Highlighter -> Inspector -> Editor
  - Many tools still at Inspector mode, if at all.
  - DevTools hired staff: always too few people -> working on priorities.
  - Need community involvement. Individuals are motivated to create tools to solve issues they care about.
  - DevTools API to register tools for CSS properties
  - Contextual tool recommendations;
  - Personalize own toolset with extensions.
